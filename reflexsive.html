<p>Reflexive Verbs </p>
<p align="left">The subject and the object refer to the same person with reflexive verbs
  - the subject acts upon itself.  A reflexive verb in Portuguese will be marked
  with <em>-se</em> attached to the end of the infinitive.  These verbs are
  conjugated like regular verbs, except the reflexive pronoun agrees with case
  and gender and precedes the verb when not used in the infinitive form.  Reciprocal
  verbs are the same as reflexive except the action passes from one person
  to another.  It can only be used in the first and third person plural forms.
  Reflexive verbs sometimes use the &quot;-self&quot; forms in English, while the reciprocal
  verbs use &quot;each other.&quot; </p>
